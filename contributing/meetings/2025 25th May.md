Very high level summary:

1. June - First pass content done
2. August - New changes added
3. September - Tidy up
4. October - New teams start (in cph and aar)

Adam will share a google sheets soon which has more detail than the slides, and will stay the up to date (in case we change any dates).

### Foundation "first pass" progress

Biggest question mark is around the alignment on database tools and deployment approaches across all modules, especially Final projects. Next step involves us getting a couple of things on paper first, to discuss, then find a way forward:

1. Adam to outline learning goals/tech requirements (like this) for all courses as a starting point
2. Marco to merge the foundation databases PR as a starting point

Then we should likely have a call and finalise the remaining questions/details.

## Project actions

- [ ] (Adam) Reorganise tasks so it's clear which ones are included in the "first pass" milestone, and which are "new ideas"
