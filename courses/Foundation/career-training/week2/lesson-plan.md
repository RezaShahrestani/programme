# Lesson Plan

## Session Goal

Guide trainees to understand how their CV and LinkedIn profile should work in harmony to present a complete and professional image to recruiters. Provide tools, examples, and hands-on practice in critiquing and improving their online presence.

### 1. Review All Materials

Familiarize yourself with [all the content that we ask trainees to prepare for](preparation.md). Specifically:

- The reading preparation
- The LinkedIn prfile examples provided

### 2. Update & Review Your Own Professional Profiles (Optional but Helpful)

Bring up-to-date and share your own LinkedIn or CV (if comfortable) as an example to increase trust and demonstrate transparency.

### 3. Prepare Examples for Breakout Review

Select 1–2 fictional or anonymized real CVs and LinkedIn profiles with common issues (e.g. vague language, inconsistent job dates, etc.).

Prepare guiding questions for breakout rooms:

- Is the professional story coherent across platforms?
- Are skills clearly communicated?
- Is there any missing or confusing information?

Ask each group to identify:

1. Strengths and weaknesses
1. Inconsistencies or red flags
1. Suggestions for improvement
