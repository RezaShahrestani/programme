# Career Training (Week 3)

This session is for practicing for a screening interview and receiving feedback from peers and volunteers. **This is an in-person, full Sunday session.**

You've made a lot of progress on your CVs and LinkedIn profiles so far, and now you get the opportunity to practice a **screening interview**. Watch out in your teams' slack channel, where you will receive a case to prepare for.

We will also bring a camera so that you can get updated photos for your LinkedIn and CV, so wear the clothing you would like to have on your professional profile!
