# Lesson Plan

## Session Format

In-person, full-day Sunday session focused on realistic screening interviews, peer feedback, and volunteer involvement. Trainees present themselves with an elevator pitch, and give answers based on a case that they’ve been preparing for over the prior 2.5 days.

## Session Goal

Create a realistic but supportive interview environment where trainees can:
- Practice giving their elevator pitch clearly and confidently
- Gain actionable feedback on both technical and soft skills
- Improve their readiness for real interviews

Key message to reinforce: *“It’s not about having the perfect experience - it’s about clearly explaining your skills, competencies and potential in the role.”*

TODO add further notes about screening interview prep, including slack message to send
