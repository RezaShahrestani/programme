    - Based on our discussion, what value do you feel I could bring to the team?
    - Are there any gaps in my experience that you are concerned about?
    -     - What are the next steps and when should I be expecting to hear from you?
    - What is the tech stack of your company?
    - What do the internal processes at your company look like? (workflow, growth plan, onboarding plan)
    - What is the team composition? (the team you are interviewing for)
    - What is the most important trait of the position?
    - Questions that matter to you (depends on your personal circumstances, maybe you would like to work remotely, maybe you would like to have a mentor, etc)
