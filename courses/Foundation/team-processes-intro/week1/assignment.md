Some ideas so far:

1. Write and prioritize your own user stories:
   Think of a simple app (e.g. a task manager, recipe app, or class planner). Write 3 user stories, and prioritize them using the MoSCoW method.

2. Backlog breakdown practice:
   Choose one user story you wrote and break it down into smaller technical tasks (e.g. design a page, set up routing, fetch data, write test).
