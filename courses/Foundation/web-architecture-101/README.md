# Web Architecture 101

This module takes a rather different form from all of the other modules.
It's in the form of a presentation, which is provided here in Keynote, PDF, and HTML forms.

The purpose of this module is to provide a mental model of how the remaining technical modules fit together.

You don't have to _remember_ and _learn_ everything in the presentation.
Instead, it's all about getting an overview of how web sites work, some of the terminology,
and how that relates to the coming modules.

After the presentation, you may find the [recap](./recap.md) useful.
