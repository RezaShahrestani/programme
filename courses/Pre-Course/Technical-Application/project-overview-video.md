# 📺 Project overview video

The purpose of the project overview video is for us to learn a little bit about you and hear about your experience building the Event Page improvements.&#x20;

1. Make a video recording of yourself talking about your experiences building the project[event-page-technical-task](event-page-technical-task/ "mention")

Please don't be worried, we know this may be your first time doing something like this, so try not to be intimidated! The video does not need to be very polished and professional - we just want to get to know you a bit and see how the technical task was for you!

The video should include the following:

- State your name
- In 2-3 sentences, describe how the freeCodeCamp courses went for you - how much time did you spend on them? Was it all new material for you? Was it difficult?
- In 3-5 sentences, describe how you built the \<footer> - what methods did you use to make it look like the [event-page-design.md](event-page-technical-task/event-page-design.md "mention")?
- In 3-5 sentences, describe how you built the navigation, what methods did you use to make it look like the [event-page-design.md](event-page-technical-task/event-page-design.md "mention")?

The video should be maximum 5 minutes long.
