# Preparation for (semi) flipped classroom

This is the preparation for the (semi) flipped classroom (vs. "old style" presential classes).

We say (semi) flipped classroom, because part of the teaching is still done on the Sunday class.

## Setting up MySQL and MySQL Workbench

Before the class you should install MySQL and MySQL on your computer:

## Class videos

Since this is a semi flipped classroom, where you prepare the class during the week and then the teaching on Sunday will build on what you prepared, it is **_extremely important_** that you watch the following videos:

- [introduction to databases, part 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrIOqad0fMVpbFgp1-9g1rvd7peMeu-e/view?usp=sharing);
- [introduction to databases, part 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wvdTUgLB3KakjeKfr6rJn1T6KzpX9Uf/view?usp=sharing) ;
- [introduction to SELECT queries and small exercise](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Km2knoXiZrR9TOwZZ2M7V_FLyb-X_FBA/view?usp=sharing).

## Exercise before class

Before Sunday also please do the following exercise, so that we can discuss it in the class:

- write a `SELECT` query where you select the row in the `user` table, where the user `name` is `Pablo Kisbee`.

## Checklist

You are ready for Sunday's class if:

- you have installed MySQL and MySQL Workbench;
- you have watched the `Class videos`;
- you have created the `hyf_lesson1` database on your computer (the data is [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/databases/blob/master/lesson1/lesson-data.sql));
- you have done the `SELECT` exercise.

If you run into trouble completing any of the above, please ask for help in the class channel :)
