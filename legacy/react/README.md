React is free an open-source frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. We will learn React to empower us to build even more complex applications faster.

Next.js is a popular framework which further enhances the development process and performance of our web applications. Next.js builds on top of React by adding several features and optimizations that are often required in modern web applications.

## Module goals

This course is divided in 2 modules

### [React 1](./react1/README.md) (3 weeks)

Here we will focus on:

- Why we learn React
- How to write React components in **JSX**
- How to use **props** and **state** in components
- How to react to events using **hooks**

### [React 2](./react2/README.md) (3 weeks)

In React 2 we will further expand our skills and learn:

- How to use component libraries
- How to connect to your Node.js API from the Node.js course
- How to build scalable web applications using **Context**, **Reducer**, and **Routing**

#### Individual Project (Meal Sharing App)

Additionally, you will also implement the UI for your [Meal Sharing App](./react2/Meal-sharing/homework.md) using the skills you learn in this course. :rocket:

## Read up before we get started

1. Watch the [React introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3AkSS5hXMA)
2. Read the [React landing page](https://react.dev)
3. Read the [Next.js landing page](https://nextjs.org)

## Beyond Next.js

Unfortunately, we won't be able to cover all areas of React in this course, but only the essentials. There are a lot of powerful tools out there for you to learn after you finish this course such as:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - a way to annotate ES6 with types
- **[Redux](https://redux.js.org)** - predictable (application) state container, a Flux implementation
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Open-source CSS framework
