## Exercises

### Exercises Part 1

#### 1. Create a reusable Button component (10 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `Button`.
2. Accept `text` and `onClick` as props.
3. Render a button element with the `text` prop as its content.
4. Attach the `onClick` prop to the button's `onClick` event handler.

#### 2. Create a Card component (15 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `Card`.
2. Accept `title`, `description`, and `imageUrl` as props.
3. Use destructuring to extract the props.
4. Render a card-like structure with the provided `title`, `description`, and `imageUrl`.

#### 3. Create a Layout component (10 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `Layout`.
2. Accept `children` as a prop.
3. Render a layout structure (e.g., header, main content area, footer) with the `children` prop rendered inside the main content area.

#### 4. Implement conditional rendering (10 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `ToggleContent`.
2. Accept a `show` prop as a boolean value.
3. Accept `content` as a prop, which can be a string or a React element.
4. Render the `content` prop only if the `show` prop is true, otherwise render a message or nothing.

### Exercises Part 2

#### 5. Create a Counter component (10 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `Counter`.
2. Use the `useState` hook to manage a count state variable.
3. Implement functions to increment and decrement the count.
4. Render the current count value and buttons to call the increment and decrement functions.

#### 6. Develop a Form component (10 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `Form`.
2. Use the `useState` hook to manage the state of form input fields.
3. Implement a function to handle form submission.
4. Render input fields for each form field and a submit button.

#### 7. Create a ParentChild component set (10 minutes)

1. Create a new component called `Parent`.
2. Create another component called `Child`.
3. In the `Parent` component, use the `useState` hook to manage a state variable.
4. Implement a function to update the state variable.
5. Render the `Child` component and pass the state variable and the update function as props.
6. In the `Child` component, render the data received from the parent and a button to call the update function.
