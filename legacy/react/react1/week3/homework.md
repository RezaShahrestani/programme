# Homework

Complete this week's tasks in the [React 1 homework project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/react-1-hw)

## Meal sharing

For this, you will work in your meal-sharing repository - the same that you worked on in the **Node** module.

You have just learned **fetching** and rendering the fetched data, and you have built the backend of your meal sharing app during the Node module, so it is time to work on the frontend!

Create a `MealsList` component that fetches and renders the meals. Place the component in its own folder under `/frontend/components`.
Your component will have a `meals` state. Render the meal title, description and price at least as simple paragraphs.
Add your `MealsList` component to the home page by using it inside `/frontend/components/HomePage/HomePage.jsx`.
